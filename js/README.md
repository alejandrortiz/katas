### What is advent?
Although it has its roots in the catholic religion, advent has become a tradition where children get chocolate for 4 weeks, one a day, from the 1st to the 24th of December.

### Is this an original idea?
Since 2015, the Advent Of Code is celebrated with programming challenges every day. In this case, the challenges are meant to be solved with JavaScript.
